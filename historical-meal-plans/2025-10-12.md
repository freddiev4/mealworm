Notes / important constraints:
- I attempted to check the meal-planning database for the last 30 meals but couldn't access the historical meal plan data from the system — please confirm if any of these dishes were in your last 10 meal plans; I can swap any that conflict.
- Plan follows your preferences: no pesto/capers/olives; sauces included on every meal; one easy mostly pre-made frozen option (salmon burgers + frozen sweet potato fries); no stir-fries; leaning into Italian, Latin, and American flavors.

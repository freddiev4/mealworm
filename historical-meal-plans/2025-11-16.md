If you want, I can:
- Replace any recipes with specific chef links you prefer (I used reputable recipe pages above).
- Swap the eating-out night to Saturday instead of Friday.
- Run web searches to find alternate recipes (I attempted to run a web search but the helper tool was unavailable; I included direct links to well-known recipe pages)."}
